# Traceformer
Traceformer is a transformer-based side-channel analysis framework for masked AES on ASCAD. It uses a BERT plaintext pathway with late fusion, a fixed 1,400-sample window, key-rank-0 evaluation, cross-desynchronization testing, and saved indices/normalization for fully reproducible experiments (including ablations and per-byte heatmaps).
